# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023

The NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual hackathon organized by NASA in collaboration with various partners, aimed at solving real-world problems related to Earth and space. Participants from around the globe form teams to work on challenges that range from data analysis and software development to hardware design and artistic projects. The event fosters innovation and collaboration, providing a platform for citizens to engage with NASA's open data and contribute to space exploration and environmental monitoring.

## Challenge Details

### Immersed in the Sounds of Space

In this project, we are focused on sonifying 3D "fly-through" videos generated from 2D astronomical photos provided by NASA. These fly-throughs simulate what it would be like to navigate through space objects in three dimensions. Our goal is to create a unique auditory experience that offers an alternative perspective for understanding and appreciating the wonders of the universe, complementing the visual fly-throughs.

## Submission

Our system is capable of taking a timelapsed photoset and produce a fly-through video with sonified audio that represents the original photoset. To see the live videos, check out the link below:
